# Android-Developer-Challenge
An app is developed to retrieve nutrition information for different food types, persist it locally and display it to the user in a very interesting manner.

This is my very first try on the development of android app without any prior experience and the app is build within a week as stated in the challenge. It's a great experience indeed!
